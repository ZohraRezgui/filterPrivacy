# ðŸ§  Controllable Privacy in Face Recognition: A Filter-based Approach Official Repo

This repository contains the **official training code** for our paper:

> **Controllable Privacy in Face Recognition: A Filter-based Approach**
> *Z Rezgui, N Strisciuglio, R Veldhuis*
> *IJCB, 2024*

Our research explores methods for balancing **privacy protection** and **model utility** in face recognition using **adversarial training** and **information bottleneck-based techniques**.

## ðŸ“Œ Current Status

At the moment, this repository includes **only the training code** (`train.py`) and some utility files. Unfortunately, after **graduating from my university**, I lost access to the **pretrained models** that were stored on the universityâ€™s computing cluster and were not pushed to GitHub at the time.

Since I no longer have access to those files, I **won't be actively reconstructing** the missing components. However, if you're interested in using or extending the code, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™d be happy to assist with any issues.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Although pretrained models are not available, you can still experiment with the **training pipeline** and adapt it to your own datasets. Check `config.py` to modify hyperparameters and file paths as needed.
