Our research explores methods for balancing privacy protection and model utility in face recognition using adversarial training and information bottleneck-based techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Current Status

At the moment, this repository includes **only the training code** (`train.py`) and some utility files. Unfortunately, after graduating from my university, I lost access to the **pretrained models** that were stored on the universityâ€™s computing cluster and were not pushed to GitHub at the time.

Since I no longer have access to those files, I **won't be actively reconstructing** the missing components. However, if you're interested in using or extending the code, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™d be happy to assist with any issues.

## Getting Started

Although pretrained models are not available, you can still experiment with the **training pipeline** and adapt it to your own datasets. Check `config.py` to modify hyperparameters and file paths as needed.

### Prerequisites
We use **Poetry** for managing the project's dependencies. Poetry ensures that all required libraries are installed in a consistent and isolated environment.

Once you have Poetry installed, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

 ```sh
poetry install
```
This will install both the regular and development dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml` and lock the exact versions in the `poetry.lock` file.

Poetry automatically creates a virtual environment for the project. You can activate it with:
```sh
poetry shell
```
